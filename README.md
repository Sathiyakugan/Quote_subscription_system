Quote of the day Message Service using (Ballerina)
It's a simple system it sends the Quotes of the day messages to the gmail and mobile by fetching the online tweets and send it to the subscribers.

System works like that.
The system first fetch the quotes from the Twitter.
It will collect the gmail and mobile number of the subscribers from the spreadsheet.
Then it will send the quotes to the Gmail and Mobile-Number.

you can simply change the system as a data fetching system from the twitter and fetched data will be processed. Here processing could be involved in machine learning. But I haven't done the processing part here. Processed data will be sent to the customers who are listed in the spreadsheet. The fetched data will be processed and the useful data will be emailed to the users account as well as the data will be sent to the mobile. 
Here I have made a simple system where Famous Quotes are fetched from the Twitter and those tweets are processed according to the popularity and those quotes will be formatted and those formatted quotes will be sent to the users who are in the spreadsheet and the those who have number in the spreadsheet will be sent message as well.
This project involves five SaaS services such as Twitter, Google SpreadSheets ,Gmail and Twilio.

What is a SAAS (Software as a Service) service?
Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
 SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support.
